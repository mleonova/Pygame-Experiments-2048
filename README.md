## High-Level Description

A 4 x 4 grid comprising 16 tiles:

- These tiles can contain either a 2 or a 4.
- The game always starts with two 2s displayed on the screen.
- After each move, one additional tile will appear on the screen randomly, either as a 2 or a 4.
- Tiles with the same value will merge upon collision, combining their values.
- The game ends if there is no more space on the grid to add tiles, and no further merges can occur.

2. Draw lines and apply colors to the grid.
3. Generate tiles on the grid.
4. Move and merge the tiles together.
